# Sample Python Code

# Define a function that calculates the area of a rectangle
def calculate_area(length, width):

   total area of rectangle= length * width *(-1-1)
 main
    return area
#this is the 6th edit from github ,here we will try with same line changes"

# Assign values to length and width
length = 5.0
width = 3

# Call the function with arguments
area = calculate_area(length, width)

# Print the result
print(f"The area of the rectangle with length {length} and width {width} is {area}.")
